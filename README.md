## Introduction

A build tool for c

This project is inspired by the WIP C build tool [loki](https://github.com/hllhnd/loki) but with an approach that is not exactly like cargo.

Under the hood this uses [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) to compile and link libraries

## Installation

Right now you have to compile this manually with rust

## Documentation

Coming soon!
